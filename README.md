# Named-Entity-Recognition-NLP
This project leverages Named Entity Recognition (NER) to automatically identify and extract key entities—such as names, organizations, locations, and dates—from unstructured text data. Built with spaCy, it provides an end-to-end pipeline for entity extraction, visualization, and customization for domain-specific applications.
